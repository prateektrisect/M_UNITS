Problem Statement
Given a 4 digit number n as input, find the sum of its digits. Note that n%10 gives
its last digit, whereas n/10 removes the last digit. So if n=2456, n%10 is 6 and
n/10 is 245. So, run a for loop from 1 to 4 and in the loop do 2 things – calculate
the last digit and then remove the last digit.
