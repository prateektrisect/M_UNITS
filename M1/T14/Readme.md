## Problem Statement
Given two numbers x and y as input, find the HCF of x and y. Note that HCF is the
largest number that will divide both x and y. If we run a loop from 1 to the
smaller of x and y, we can find the largest number that divides both x and y.

**Sample Test Case**
```
Input:
x=20, y=50

Output:
10
```
## Other Test cases

**Test Case 1**
```
Input:
x=21, y=65

Output:
1
```
**Test Case 2**
```
Input:
x=102, y=102

Output:
102
```
**Test Case 3**
```
Input:
x=80, y=40

Output:
40
```
**Test Case 4**
```
Input:
x=96, y=1

Output:
1
```
**Test Case 5**
```
Input:
x=80, y=76 

Output:
4
```
